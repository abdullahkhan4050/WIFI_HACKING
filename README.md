# 🔐 Exploring WiFi Security Using ESP8266: Deauthentication & Evil Twin Attacks

I'm excited to share the results of our hands-on cybersecurity project, **"Exploring WiFi Security Using ESP8266"**.  
The core purpose of this experiment was simple: **to understand WiFi vulnerabilities** and **learn defensive measures** through ethical hacking in a controlled lab environment.

Our work focuses on understanding offensive techniques so we can build stronger defenses.

## 🛠️ The Tool: ESP8266

The heart of this experiment was the **ESP8266**, a low-cost WiFi microcontroller.

- **Capability:** We leveraged its ability to send deauthentication packets and host a fake Access Point (AP) to simulate real-world attacks.  
- **Application:** This device is widely used in IoT security research.

## 🧪 The Ethical Lab Tests

We conducted two primary ethical security tests in a controlled lab environment:

### 1. Deauthentication Attack
- **Definition:** Disconnecting users by sending deauthentication frames to the network.  
- **Learning:** This test showed how sudden disruption of internet access can occur and forms the basis of more advanced attacks, including the Evil Twin attack.

### 2. Evil Twin Attack
- **Definition:** Setting up a fake WiFi network identical to our original network to simulate credential harvesting.  
- **Why it's Dangerous:** Demonstrated how easily users can connect accidentally and have credentials captured. This attack is commonly used in phishing and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) scenarios.

## 🎯 Core Objectives & Learning Outcomes

- **Packet Handling:** Gained a deep understanding of how the ESP8266 handles network packets.  
- **Ethical Testing:** Performed WiFi security tests and studied how these attacks work.  
- **Defense Building:** Learned how to prevent attacks through secure configurations and user awareness.  
- **Skill Building:** Built foundational cybersecurity skills in practical scenarios.

## ⚖️ Ethical Commitment

This project remained strictly for **educational and awareness purposes**:

- **Scope:** Testing was limited to our **own WiFi network**.  
- **Exclusion:** No third-party devices were used.
